                <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
                <p>After a few months out of the spotlight, The District Heat is returning to the stage with their debut album. It only takes a glance to see that their <i>energy and enthusiasm</i> on stage is a reflection of how much they <i>love what they do</i>.
                </p>
                <p>With a sound described as everything from the <b>Foo Fighters</b> to <b>The Shins</b>, the band blends their diverse influences into a modern rock feel. <b>Beatroute</b> has described them as "bluesy rock with pop sensibility". This meld of genres has given The District Heat a very unique sound that has qualities everyone can enjoy.

                            After that was Sean, Stewart, Francis, and Brandon , the boys from The District Heat. They call themselves an Indie act , but their <b>original sound and songs scream pure rock and roll</b> , look them up on Itunes and throw them support , watch for these guys , with their <i>great stage presence and polished sound</i>, they are destined for big things. we would love to share the bill with you guys again any time.

                            [The] District Heat released their self-titled album that night and kicked the evening off with a bang, playing <i>bluesy rock</i> with <i>pop sensibility</i> and mixing in <b>more harmonies than The Beatles could shake a stick at</b>. They had the crowd in the palm of their hands and it was easy to tell they were all on a performance high that only they could understand because all of their hard work had finally come to fruition.
