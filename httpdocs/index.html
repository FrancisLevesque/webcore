                <h1>THE DISTRICT HEA<u>R</u>T</h1>
                <h3 class="date">February 5th, 2015</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Months ago, in between recording sessions, we spent a lot of time discussing imagery and colour schemes that could represent the album and define our aesthetic as a band. Thanks to everyone who has susbequently complimented us on the album cover and new merch designs! As a show of gratitude, I'm providing a peek behind the curtain by sharing the original artwork that eventually became the album cover.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="styles/img/blog/artwork.jpg" align="center" alt="Album Art">
                <div>
                    <p>As you can tell from the merits of the drawing, we hired an accomplished kindergarten-aged child as our concept artist; don't worry - he was locally grown, free-range, and 100% organic. I'm kidding of course. I'll admit that I drew this wholeheartedly with focus and intent, and while it certainly provided a strong creative foundation, I felt that our album deserved something more polished. It was only through the magic touch of graphics software (and some riveting photography of concrete) that the final result was achievable. So the next time you look at our album cover, take a second to remember its humble beginnings as a shaky-penciled, hastily-coloured drawing that would have been more comfortable on a refrigerator than fronting a collection of indie rock tunes.</p>

                        <p>You know how sometimes you enter a 50/50 draw at your local team’s sporting event or enter your name at a fine drinking establishment in order to win whatever themed item they have hanging above the counter with absolutely zero expectations of winning? But then you actually win. Well, this is that feeling times about one million and one.</p>

                        <p>A little while ago X92.9 was advertising a new Calgary festival that was going to go down for the first time this upcoming May. Staged at MacEwan Hall, the Limelight Music Festival is an all ages show aimed at promoting local talent. And we got in. HOLY SHIT! Every time I repeat that to myself I get so jazzed. I’m actually vibrating with giddiness a little bit as I type.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>I distinctly remember receiving their response and already being in the mind set of, &quot;Yeah, we didn’t make it, but at least we tried…&quot; In fact I’m confident that I actually read the text incorrectly my first glance over as I didn’t want to dwell on the rejection for too long. Something flicked in my brain though, and after reading it a little more carefully I actually jumped out of my chair and double fist pumped the sky. So amazing to see confirmation that it's not just your parents and close friends who &quot;like&quot; your music, but an actual stranger liked us more than 68 other bands!</p>

                        <p>It seems like we’ve been away for quite a while, however we have been hard at work on our debut album! Between writing, recording, editing, working on artwork, signing contracts and all the other behind the scenes work that goes into making a record we’ve been very busy. We are beyond excited to share the fruits of our labour with you. We’ll be selling the album, along with some other accompanying merchandise, at all of our upcoming shows. Can’t make it out? Don’t worry, the album is available online in places like Amazon and iTunes (check out the Music page)!</p>

                        <p>As you may have noticed we now have an official website, courtesy of our tech guru, Mr. Francis Levesque. On the website you’ll be able to find lyrics, bios, past and upcoming shows as well as this blog! We’ll update the blog with upcoming events, reflections on past events or just anything we feel the need to share with you to keep our amazing fans in the loop. As we grow as a band, the website will grow and change with us, so keep your eyes peeled for updates.</p>

                <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
                <p>After a few months out of the spotlight, The District Heat is returning to the stage with their debut album. It only takes a glance to see that their <i>energy and enthusiasm</i> on stage is a reflection of how much they <i>love what they do</i>.
                </p>
                <p>With a sound described as everything from the <b>Foo Fighters</b> to <b>The Shins</b>, the band blends their diverse influences into a modern rock feel. <b>Beatroute</b> has described them as "bluesy rock with pop sensibility". This meld of genres has given The District Heat a very unique sound that has qualities everyone can enjoy.
