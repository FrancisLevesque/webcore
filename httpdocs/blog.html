                    <p>It seems like we’ve been away for quite a while, however we have been hard at work on our debut album. Between writing, recording, editing, working on artwork and all the other behind the scenes work that goes into making a record we’ve been very busy. We are beyond excited to share the fruits of our labour with you all tonight at Dickens pub with some amazing local bands. We’ll be selling the album along with some other accompanying merchandise at the show. Can’t make it to the show? Don’t worry, the album is available online in places like Amazon and iTunes (check out the <a href="music.html">Music</a> page)! Also, we plan to play many shows in the near future where you will be able to purchase the record, all of which we will make sure to tell you about. </p>

                    <p>As you may have noticed we now have an official website, courtesy of our tech guru, Mr. Francis Levesque. On the website you’ll be able to find lyrics, bios, available merchandise, past and upcoming shows as well as this blog! We’ll update the blog with upcoming events, reflections on past events or just anything we feel the need to share with you to keep our amazing fans in the loop. As we grow as a band, the website will grow and change with us, so keep your eyes peeled for updates. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>So, if you’re available tonight, come out to show, rock out with us and maybe come have a beer with the band afterwards. We go on at 9pm sharp. It’s been a long time, but damn, it feels good to be back. Let’s do this thing.</p>
