                    <p>It seems like we’ve been away for quite a while, however we have been hard at work on our debut album. Between writing, recording, editing, working on artwork and all the other behind the scenes work that goes into making a record we’ve been very busy. We are beyond excited to share the fruits of our labour with you. We’ll be selling the album, along with some other accompanying merchandise, at all of our upcoming shows. Can’t make it out? Don’t worry, the album is available online in places like Amazon and iTunes (check out the Music page)!</p>

                    <p>As you may have noticed we now have an official website, courtesy of our tech guru, Mr. Francis Levesque. On the website you’ll be able to find lyrics, bios, available merchandise, past and upcoming shows as well as this blog! We’ll update the blog with upcoming events, reflections on past events or just anything we feel the need to share with you to keep our amazing fans in the loop. As we grow as a band, the website will grow and change with us, so keep your eyes peeled for updates.</p>

                    <p>It seems like we’ve been away for quite a while, however we have been hard at work on our debut album. Between writing, recording, editing, working on artwork and all the other behind the scenes work that goes into making a record we’ve been very busy. We are beyond excited to share the fruits of our labour with you. We’ll be selling the album, along with some other accompanying merchandise, at all of our upcoming shows. Can’t make it out? Don’t worry, the album is available online in places like Amazon and iTunes (check out the Music page)!</p>

                    <p>As you may have noticed we now have an official website, courtesy of our tech guru, Mr. Francis Levesque. On the website you’ll be able to find lyrics, bios, available merchandise, past and upcoming shows as well as this blog! We’ll update the blog with upcoming events, reflections on past events or just anything we feel the need to share with you to keep our amazing fans in the loop. As we grow as a band, the website will grow and change with us, so keep your eyes peeled for updates.</p>

                <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
                <p>After a few months out of the spotlight, The District Heat is returning to the stage with their debut album. It only takes a glance to see that their energy and enthusiasm on stage is a reflection of how much they love what they do. With a sound described as everything from the Foo Fighters to The Shins, the band blends their diverse influences into a modern rock feel. Beatroute has described them as "bluesy rock with pop sensibility". This meld of genres has given The District Heat a very unique sound that has qualities everyone can enjoy.</p>
